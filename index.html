              Lakshya is an amazing leader. Her leadership style is by doing. She passes on credit when the team wins and owns up the brickbats when something fails.
              In the community space, all the ambassadors contribute to their tech communities during their spare time. And they have no obligation to contribute within deadlines unless they are deeply motivated.
              Lakshya does this by having a one on one relationship with all the ambassadors, empowering them to be leaders and helping them with all the support when needed.

              Doing a task ourselves is often easier than getting it done by a big team, but her patience, planning, execution, comradeship, and ownership of the task at hand are perfect.
              I'm reminded of the analogy of a garland of flowers, the thread doesn't show at all, but it is what pulls all the flowers together.
              Her passion for women in tech, helping them fight bias is incredible.
              Mark my words, she's a great leader in the making.
